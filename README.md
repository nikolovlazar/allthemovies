Hello there! If you're coming from my Android Worldwide talk, thanks for watching! 🙏

This is a demo Android Jetpack Compose app that implements Sentry's Issues and Profiling feature. Feel free to clone it and play around with it.

> ⚠️ **Important:** make sure you change the DSN string within the AndroidManifest.xml file with the one of your project, because I'll be deactivating this one. 
> 
> To obtain a DSN, [go register a Sentry account](https://sentry.io/signup/?utm_medium=event&utm_source=android-worldwide&utm_campaign=android&utm_content=talk&utm_term=), create an Android project, and you'll get your own DSN.
